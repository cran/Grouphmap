Description: The 'Grouphmap' was implemented in R, an open-source programming environment, and was released under the provided website. The difference analysis is based on the 'limma' package, which can cover gene and protein expression profiles (Reference: Matthew E Ritchie , Belinda Phipson , Di Wu , Yifang Hu , Charity W Law , Wei Shi , Gordon K Smyth (2015) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkv007>). The GO enrichment analysis is based on the 'clusterProfiler' package and supports three common species: human, mouse, and yeast (Reference: Guangchuang Yu, Li-Gen Wang, Yanyan Han, Qing-Yu He (2012) <doi:10.1089/omi.2011.0118>). The results of batch difference analysis and enrichment analysis are output in separate folders for easy viewing and further visualization of the results during the process. The results returned a heatmap in R and exported to 3 folders named DEG, go, and merge.
